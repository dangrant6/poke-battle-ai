## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    - python -m venv venv
    - source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
3. Run pip install -r requirements.txt

## OpenRouter API Key Setup

This game uses the OpenRouter API for AI-generated content. Follow these steps to obtain an API key:

1. Visit the [OpenRouter website](https://openrouter.ai/).
2. Sign up
4. Once logged in, navigate to Keys on your profile.
5. Click "Create Key".
6. Copy the generated API key. It should look like a long string of letters and numbers.
7. In the project directory, create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`:
8. Open the `.env` file and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenRouter API key:
    - OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

## Running the Game

After completing the installation and API key setup, you can run the game using the following command:
    - python battle.py

## Gameplay Instructions

1. **Pokémon Selection**: Use number keys 1-9 (0 for the 10th Pokémon) to select your team of three Pokémon.
2. **Battle**: 
   - Each turn, select a move using number keys 1-4.
   - The AI opponent will choose its moves automatically.
   - The battle continues until all Pokémon on one side are defeated.
3. **Victory/Defeat**: After the battle, a victory or defeat screen will be displayed with appropriate music.
